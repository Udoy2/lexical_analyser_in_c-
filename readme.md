# Lexical Analyzer

ðŸš€ A simple lexical analyzer for custom code! ðŸ“„

## Description
This project is a basic lexical analyzer that processes code from a file named `text.mylang`. It identifies and categorizes tokens, providing basic error handling for incorrect syntax.

## Features
- Reads code from `text.mylang`
- Identifies tokens such as variables, operators, and delimiters
- Provides basic error detection for invalid token initialization

## Usage
1. Place your code in a file named `text.mylang`.
2. Run the program to analyze and print the identified tokens.

## Example
```cpp
// Sample code in text.mylang
int x = 10 + 20;
```

The output will display all lexemes (tokens) identified in the code.
